# Data Scientist/AI Engineer

## Work Experience
**Data Scientist @ US AI (_April 2024 - Present_)**
- Independently developed, deployed, and maintained a production-grade generative AI system for analyzing client cybersecurity compliance posture, processing sensitive and classified data and generating $750K+ in annual revenue
- Redesigned US AIâ€™s model serving architecture using clean code principles and scalable design patterns (Factory, Adapter), enabling modular self-hosting of 100+ ML algorithms and nearly 100 LLMs
- Led R&D initiative to train a large language model from scratch via distributed training on a 20-node Kubernetes cluster; productionized the pipeline as a reusable training feature within the Forsight platform

**Data Science Consultant @ Haver Analytics (_September 2023 - March 2024_)**
- Conducted data collection, cleansing, processing, and analysis using **Excel** and **Python** for building a proof of concept model to deterministically and probabilistically classify B2B sales opportunities as either won or lost outcomes.
- Currently designing two user interfaces for Haver's sales team:
    - Generate a probability of a closed won sale based on the sale's individual characteristics
    - Generate an expected value of an entire sales pipeline using predicted probabilities of individual sales outcomes in the pipeline.

**Economic Database Consultant @ Haver Analytics (_January 2022 - March 2024_)**
- Used **Python's** BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages to automate internal procedures for updating databases containing time sensitve economic and financial data. This resulted in speed improvements of **25%-99%** depending on the procedure.
