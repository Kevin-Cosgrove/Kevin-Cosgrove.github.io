## Work Experience
**Data Science Consultant @ Haver Analytics (_September 2023 - Present_)**
- Conducted data collection, cleansing, processing, and analysis using **Excel** and **Python** for building a proof of concept model to deterministaclly and probabilistically classify B2B sales opportunities as either won or lost outcomes.
- Currently designing two user interfaces for Haver's sales team:
    - Generate a probability of a closed won sale based on the sale's individual characteristics
    - Generate an expected value of an entire sales pipeline using predicted probabilities of individual sales outcomes in the pipeline.

**Database Consultant @ Haver Analytics(_Jan 2022 - Present_)**
- Used **Python's** BeautifulSoup and Selenium packages to automate internal procedures for updating databases containing time sensitve economic and financial data. This resulted in speed improvements of **25%-95%** depending on the procedure.

## Projects
### B2B Sales Opportunity Outcome Predictor with KNN
[Repo]()

Developed a proof of concept model for predicting probabilistic outcomes of technical B2B sales opportunities using **Excel** and **Python**. This data-driven approach led to the selection of KNN as the best fit model. 
The proposed model will be used to provide point predictions for new individual sales opportunities as well as provide an expected value of the entire organizations current sales pipeline. This will allow the sales team to allocate resources to individual sales according to data driven insights and assess the health of the entire sales pipeline, respectively.

### Data Visualization of Earthquakes Across the Globe (2001-2023
[Repo]()

Used **Python** to clean, process, and analyze over 700 unique earthquakes across the globe whose magnitude was at least 6.5 or larger.  Visualizations include feature distributions, a feature correlation heat map, a geographic scatter plot, a geograpgic density plot, and more.
